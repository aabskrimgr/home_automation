# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Currently supported versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our home automation system seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: [your-security-email@example.com]

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, authentication bypass, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the issue within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing

## Security Considerations

### Firebase Security
- Never commit `google-services.json` to public repositories
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict database access
- Enable Firebase Authentication for production use
- Regularly rotate API keys

### ESP32 Security
- Change default WiFi credentials immediately
- Use WPA3 or WPA2 security on your WiFi network
- Consider using HTTPS for Firebase communication
- Implement device authentication tokens

### Network Security
- Use a separate IoT network for smart devices
- Implement firewall rules to isolate IoT devices
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity
- Regular firmware updates

### Physical Security
- Secure ESP32 devices in tamper-proof enclosures
- Use proper electrical safety measures
- Implement physical access controls
- Consider backup power systems

### Code Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure coding practices
- Regular dependency updates

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers:
1. **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Static Analysis**: Use code analysis tools
4. **Testing**: Include security testing in CI/CD

### For Users:
1. **Network Isolation**: Use separate network for IoT devices
2. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex WiFi passwords
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep firmware and app updated
4. **Monitor Access**: Log and monitor device access

### For Deployment:
1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for secrets
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control
3. **Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging
4. **Backup**: Regular configuration backups

## Known Security Limitations

1. **Default Configuration**: Firebase rules are set to allow all read/write access
2. **No Authentication**: Current version doesn't implement user authentication
3. **Plain Text Communication**: WiFi credentials stored in plain text on ESP32
4. **No Encryption**: Data transmitted without encryption

## Planned Security Improvements

- [ ] Implement Firebase Authentication
- [ ] Add user access controls
- [ ] Encrypt ESP32 communications
- [ ] Add device authentication tokens
- [ ] Implement HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage

## Compliance

This project is designed for personal/educational use. For commercial deployment, additional security measures and compliance with local regulations may be required.

### Applicable Standards:
- IoT Security Guidelines
- Local electrical safety codes
- Data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)
